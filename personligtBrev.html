            My name is Toni Skoro and i am a very social, driven and ambitious
            man who is 25 years old. At the moment i am studying to become a
            Fullstack Developer at IT-HÃ¶gskolan Gothenburg. I am a very ambitous
            man with alot of dreams. My biggest dream is to one day create a
            game of my own, in order to succed with this, i need to learn
            everything i can at the school and also at the time i have my
            internship.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the meantime at my internship, i intend to use all of my
            experiences to learn as much as possible during that time. The more
            i learn the better i get. I intend to become one of the greatest
            developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am great with working in groups, also very experienced in
            communication and a leading role. Problem solving, analytical
            abilites is one of my great experiences from previous work.
            <br />
            <br />
            My most valuable trait, is that when i deal with criticism, i
            approach it with a open mind and add it to my own development as a
            person/developer.
